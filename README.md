Source code of "[Ground-state properties via machine learning quantum constraints](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L032043)".  
For Fermion Chain,  
  run gendata.sh to generate insulator dataset;  
  run train.sh to train ANN quantum constraints;    
  run app.sh to solve the ground state energy by constrained optimization.
